# Data

I investigate large data sets because I believe it is one of the most efficient methods, pound for pound, to understand the shape of the world and its behavior. I believe many, albeit not all, phenomena can be boiled down to mere numbers, and that these numbers can be harnessed if properly treated and contextualized.

Projects in *data/* represent some of my favorite learning experiences. Enjoy!
