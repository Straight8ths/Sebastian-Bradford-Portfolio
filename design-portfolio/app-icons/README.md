# **App Icons**

An ongoing collection of icons, designed to embody the various categories of apps that exist in our world.

Given that an app's icon is the first thing seen by a new user, there is tremendous psychological and experiential weight placed on the role of the icon. Icons not only demonstrate to users how the given app will "treat them", but also displays the _mindset_ that the user should be in when interacting with the app. For instance, the icons for meditation apps prepare us for a mindset of calmness, and the icons for fitness apps prepare us for a mindset of exertion.

In making this collection, I aim to demonstrate a survey of these _personalities_ and _mindsets_. As such, sharp attention has been paid to establishing clear visual flow and compelling color synergy, making artwork that users will actually **_want_** to click.
