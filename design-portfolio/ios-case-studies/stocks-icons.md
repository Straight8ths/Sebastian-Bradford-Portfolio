# Stocks Icons

**Observation:** The Stocks icon featured in the main Settings menu is different from the original Stocks icon. In addition to differences in shading for the underlying graph, the icons use two different blues for the vertical blue line featured in the icon. RGB values were measured directly in the center of the circle featured on each blue line, so ensure accuracy in the face of low resolution.
