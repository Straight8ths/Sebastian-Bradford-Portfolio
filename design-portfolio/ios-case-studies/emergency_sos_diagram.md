# Emergency SOS Diagram

## Observation

In Settings, under Emergency SOS, the iPhone X diagram presented to the user is not symmetric in certain locations.

## Reference

## Notch Curves

Consider the portion of the diagram displaying the Notch of the iPhone. I sectioned off a 20-pixel square area by which to study both curves.

The curve on the right side of the Notch has a steeper ascent towards vertical. For further comparison, I horizontally flipped the right-side curve and laid it over the left-side curve to compare pixel positions. I then set each layer to 50% opacity, and colored them red and green respectively.

## Bottom Curves

The body of the iPhone is not symmetrically displayed, specifically where the radius on the bottom edge begins. As before, I sectioned off a 20-pixel area from each side of the body, at the same vertical level, showing where the radius begins on each side.

The points at which the left and right curves cease being vertical, and begin their radius, are not equal.
