# Calculator Icons

**Observation:** The calculator app's icon is not identical to the icon used in the Calculator tile in Control Center.
- The Control Center calculator has a shorter screen
- Across the two instances, the calculator's body is shown with two different geometries. The Control Center calculator is shorter than the Calculator app icon.
