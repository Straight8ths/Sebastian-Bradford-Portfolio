# Air Quality Icon Styles

## Observation

The icon used to represent the Air Quality Index (AQI) appears in multiple states across iOS, and one of these states is only used once.

## Icon Versions

I've nicknamed the two versions I've come across as "sparse" and "dense" based on how the icon's circles are sized.

## Icon Locations

After looking everywhere I could find, I found the AQI icon represented in four locations:
- A customization option for the lock screen
- The main "Air Quality" pane inside the Weather app
- The location pointer within the "map" view of the Weather app
- The multi-way menu for how to customize the "map" mode mentioned above

Of these four, _only the final location features the "dense" configuration of the icon_. This is interesting because in all cases, the AQI icon appears at _the same very-small size_. If there were any windows featuring a larger-sized icon, that would certainly merit the inclusion of the additional icon in its "dense" configuration with its extra visual flare. But given these examples, I am curious as to why two icons were chosen for similar circumstances with similar size requirements.
