# Air Quality Icon Styles

## Observation

The icon used to represent the Air Quality Index (AQI) appears in multiple states across iOS, and one of these states is only used once.

## Icon Versions

I've nicknamed the two versions I've come across as "sparse" and "dense" based on how the icon's circles are sized.
