## Voice Memo Icons

**Observation:** The Voice Memos icon as shown in Control Center is not identical to the Voice Memos app icon. Even when accounting for the different amount of structural elements in each design, the actual contour of the "recording" that is being displayed is different across the two locations.

A counter-argument to this observation is the fact that a Control Center tile is supposed to _intentionally_ serve as a lower-fidelity signifier _which stands in for the actual app icon it is borrowed from._ However, this philosophy is _not_ held universally across Control Center tiles, because for example, the Camera tile is _identical_ to its respective app icon (save for perhaps the stroke width of the line representing the lens.)

Additionally, the Voice Memos icon is represented in another way within the main Settings menu.

A close-up comparison shows that this icon is indeed different than the source Voice Memos icon, but only slightly.

This makes me curious about the potential design advantages of the logo used in Settings. One idea could relate to the prioritization of pixels at that small of a scale. If each icon in Settings is only allowed a small amount of space, it may be more advantageous to minutely adjust the app icons that appear in that context in order to maximize what their visuals aim to convey.

Said another way: Given that the user likely associates the Voice Memos app with the cascading series of red sound bars in the app icon, it may make sense to tailor the Settings version of the icon so that the red bars are visually prioritized. This is achieved here by placing the blue playhead off-center with respect to the body of the icon and allowing more red bars to show than white. This differs with the Voice Memos icon itself, which utilizes an even split.
