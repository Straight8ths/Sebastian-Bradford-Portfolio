# **Portfolio**

Welcome! This repo is a curation of my skills, interests, and domains of expertise.

## My Value Prop:
Dual-subject expertise in design and data manipulation. I work to create aesthetically beautiful data, and mathematically rigorous art.

The two main branches are **design** and **data**. Each branch contains projects, observations, tools, and case studies.

Categories may be redefined and rescoped as projects are added.

### Thank you,
Sebastian
