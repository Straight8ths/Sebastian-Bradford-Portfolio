# **Portfolio**

Welcome! This repo is a curation of my skills, interests, and domains of expertise.

My Value Prop: Dual-subject expertise in design and data manipulation. The data models I make are aesthetically smooth, and the art I make is mathematically rigorous.

The two main branches are **design** and **data**. Each branch contains projects, observations, tools, and case studies.

Categories may be redefined and rescoped as projects are added.

### Thank you,
Sebastian
