# **Sebastian Bradford: Portfolio**

Welcome! This repo is a curation of my skills, interests, and domains of expertise.

### My Value Proposition
Dual-subject expertise in design and data manipulation. I strive to create aesthetically beautiful data, as well as mathematically rigorous art.

### Table of Contents
The two main branches are **design** and **data**. Each branch contains projects, observations, tools, and case studies.

Categories may be redefined and rescoped as projects are added.

### Thank you,
Sebastian
