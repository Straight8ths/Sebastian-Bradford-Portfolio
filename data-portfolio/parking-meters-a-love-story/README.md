## Overview

Some time ago, I was looking for ways to sharpen my Excel skills outside of work, with a focus on the manipulation of large and irregular datasets. Eventually, I found SF Open Data, the central repository of city-wide data managed by the City of San Francisco. This database is filled with intriguing datasets, including:
- Aicraft Passenger Statistics
- Film Locations in San Francisco
- Temporary Street Closures

and my personal favorite...
- **SFMTA Parking Meter Detailed Revenue Transactions**

This dataset is a continuously updated feed of *every transaction* logged across the parking meter network of San Francisco. At last count, the dataset contains 198 million rows which can be queried and exported as the user desires. One week's worth of transaction data ends up occupying about 300,000 rows, so I have chosen to analyze this data in one-week blocks.

Following is a collection of my observations and conclusions drawn from this data. I selected a random week of this year to analyze, which ended up being **May 11th to May 17th, 2025.**

# General Statistics
