## A Quest for Consonance

In music theory, we often talk about **intervals**, which is a way to classify gaps between two notes where one is higher than another. We can stack multiple
notes together to make **chords**, and every chord has a different set
of intervals present within it. If we imagine chords as if they are buildings, each note in the chord is like a floor of the building, and the intervals of the chord are like the differences in height between each floor.
