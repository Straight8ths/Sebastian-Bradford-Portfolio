Using Excel to apply rules to a genre known for its rulebreaking.

_This write-up contains concepts drawing from advanced music theory and jazz composition. Efforts have been made to distill the language and make it accessible for all audiences regardless of experience level._

## A Quest for Consonance

In music theory, we often talk about **intervals**, which is a way to classify the gap between two notes where one is higher than another. We can stack multiple notes together to make **chords**, and every chord has a different set
of intervals present within it. If we imagine a chord as if it's a building, each note in the chord is like a floor of the building, and the intervals of the chord are like the distances between each floor.

Because of the way the human brain is wired, certain intervals between notes sound more harmonious than others. Moreover, across the various musical traditions of the world, the same interval could be perceived in multiple ways, either as consonant or not. Therefore, we need to clarify that this exploration is intentionally focused on the tradition of jazz, and the widely-accepted frameworks present within that genre specifically.

So how can we classify these intervals, and their level of consonance or dissonance? In western music, an interval's name traditionally has two parts. The first part is a special adjective such as "major" or "minor". The second part is a number explaining the interval's size. When we put these two parts together, we form names such as "major third" or "minor sixth". The theory behind this naming system is not strictly relevant here, and merely knowing that the system exists is enough.

When we look at the jazz tradition, we often hear descriptions of the genre as being "expressive", and that jazz music often crosses a broad range of emotions in the mind of the listener. One way this is accomplished relates to intervals. Jazz music is fairly permissive as to which kinds of intervals can exist in chords. That is, when we compose jazz, we have a wide selection of chords to choose from, and beyond that, we can make further alterations to the intervals of our chords to achieve the exact sound we are looking for.
