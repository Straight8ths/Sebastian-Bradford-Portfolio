# Learning Jazz with Excel

## Overview:
Using Excel to apply rules to a genre known for its expressivity.

_This write-up contains concepts drawing from advanced music theory and jazz composition. Efforts have been made to distill the language and make it accessible for all audiences regardless of experience level._

## A Quest for Consonance

In music theory, we often talk about **intervals**, which is a way to classify gaps between two notes where one is higher than another. We can stack multiple
notes together to make **chords**, and every chord has a different set
of intervals present within it. If we imagine a chord as if it's a building, each note in the chord is like a floor of the building, and the intervals of the chord are like the differences in height between each floor.

Because of the way the human brain is wired, certain intervals between notes sound more harmonious than others. Moreover, across the various musical traditions of the world, the same interval could be perceived in multiple ways, either as consonant or not. Therefore, we need to clarify that this exploration is intentionally focused on the tradition of jazz, and the widely-accepted frameworks present within the genre.
