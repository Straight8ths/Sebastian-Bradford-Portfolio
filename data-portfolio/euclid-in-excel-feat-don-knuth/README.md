# Euclid in Excel (feat. Don Knuth)

Overcoming mathematical density with the use of visual calculation.

## Overview

I am continually humbled whenever I read anything written by Donald Knuth. His theoretical density and unrelenting rigor causes my brain to feel like it is running a marathon, uphill, in the mud. However, I discovered early on that I could use visual calculation methods in order to stay sane while reading his material. In this case, we'll be looking at the first section of his book _The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 1_.

In section 1.2.1, Knuth outlines an extended version of Euclid's famous GDC algorithm. He writes the following:
- "Given two positive integers m and n, we compute their greatest common divisor d, and we also compute two not-necessarily-positive integers and b such that am + bn = d." (Knuth 13)
