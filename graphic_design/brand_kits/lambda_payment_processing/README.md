## **One-liner:** A scrappy young payments firm operating in the SF Bay Area.

**Business Personality**
- Heavily staffed by, and targeting, the younger demographic.
- Heavy reliance on speed and performance at the expense of an overarching "business narrative" for customers to follow.
- Instilling a command of precision, agility, and modularity among its users.

**Design Tactics**
- Flat sheets of color which are sculpted at hard angles.
- Name and logo drawn from higher mathematics to make users feel like they are intelligent hands.
- Monospaced font to rope in the _coder_ demographic.
- Reductive, minimalist advertising focusing on single-sentence pitches.
