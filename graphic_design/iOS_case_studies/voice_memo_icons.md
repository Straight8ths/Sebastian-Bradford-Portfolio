## Voice Memo Icons

**Observation:** The voice memo icon as shown in Control Center is not identical to the Voice Memo app icon. Even when accounting for the different amount of structural elements in each design, the actual contour of the "recording" that is being displayed is different across the two locations.

A counter-argument to this observation is the fact that a Control Center tile is supposed to _intentionally_ serve as a lower-fidelity signifier _which stands in for the actual app icon it is borrowed from._ However, this philosophy is _not_ held universally across Control Center tiles, because for example, the camera tile is _identical_ to its respective app icon (save for perhaps the stroke width of the line representing the lens.)
