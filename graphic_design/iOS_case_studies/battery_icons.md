# Battery Icons

**Observation:** The battery icon as shown in the status bar is not exactly identical to the icon used in the Low Power Mode tile in Control Center. _Specifically, the battery's terminal has a rounded edge in one instance, and a flat edge in another._

I went looking for a flat-terminal battery icon in the SF Symbols library, but couldn't find one in the collection of related icons.

This makes me curious where the old icon went. Given the resolution of the iPhone X's screen, I doubt that this discrepancy is related to the scaling of icons. To double-check, I zoomed in even farther on the flat-topped battery on the Low Power tile, and checked the individual color values on the pixels directly adjacent to the right edge of the terminal, but they were identical to the background color of the tile (minor RGB differences accounting for the tile's blur).
