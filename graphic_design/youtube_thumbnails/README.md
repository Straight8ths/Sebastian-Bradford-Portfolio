# **YouTube Thumbnails**

A collection of thumbnails I designed for fictional videos, exploring the moods and visual subgenres present in modern social media. Spans technical essays, casual uploads, and those in between.

As an additional challenge, I recreated all the standard YouTube "chrome" you see here (timestamps, layout, typography) by studying the real YouTube UI.
