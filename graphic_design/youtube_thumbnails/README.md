# **YouTube Thumbnails**

A collection of thumbnails for fictional videos, exploring the moods and visual subgenres present in modern social media. Spans technical essays, casual uploads, and those in between.

As an additional challenge, I recreated all the standard YouTube "chrome" (timestamps, layout, typography) by studying the real YouTube UI.

_Video titles and channel names are intended to be wholly fictional. Any resemblance to existing content is accidental and not intended._
